# Ошибка в дизайне. Первая строка всплывающего после длительного нажатия окна визуально плохо рассмотрима, выпадает из структуры дизайна строк в всплывающем окне. Также, данная строка 
в принципе не несёт какой-либо информативности, т.к. она не кликабельна и лишь повторяет название заметки, в чем нету никакого смысла, однако если это может быть прописано в требованиях, я
не выношу это как баг.
